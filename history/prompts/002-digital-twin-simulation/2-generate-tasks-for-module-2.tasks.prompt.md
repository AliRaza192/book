# Prompt History Record

## Prompt Text

```
complete module 2 all tasks.
```

## Response Text

Generated tasks.md file for Module 2 - The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) based on the spec.md requirements. The tasks are organized by user stories in priority order (P1 through P4) with clear implementation phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (project initialization)
- Phase 2: Foundational (blocking prerequisites)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Digital Twin Fundamentals Learning (P1)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Physics Simulation Concepts (P2)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Visualization and Interaction Understanding (P3)
- Phase 6: User Story 4 - Sensor Simulation Concepts (P2)
- Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

Each task follows the required checklist format with Task ID, story labels, and specific file paths. The structure enables independent implementation and testing of each user story.

## Outcome

Successfully created tasks.md file with 40 specific, actionable tasks organized by user story priority. The tasks cover all four chapters specified in the module requirements: Digital Twins fundamentals, Gazebo physics simulation, Unity visualization, and sensor simulation. Each task includes specific file paths and follows the required format for execution.

## Evaluation

The generated tasks align with the user stories and functional requirements from the spec.md file. The organization by priority (P1-P4) ensures proper implementation sequence, and the parallel execution opportunities are clearly marked. Each user story can be implemented and tested independently as required.
