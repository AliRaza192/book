  Successfully completed all tasks for Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems. Created comprehensive documentation structure including:
  1. spec.md - Complete feature specification with user stories and requirements
  2. plan.md - Implementation plan with technical context and project structure
  3. tasks.md - Detailed task breakdown organized by user stories with phases
  4. checklists/module-4-checklist.md - Implementation checklist for quality assurance

  All deliverables follow the SDD approach with user stories organized by priority (P1, P2), clear acceptance criteria, and dependencies. The module covers Vision-Language-Action systems, voice-to-action pipelines, LLM-based cognitive planning, and capstone integration with all previous modules.

  The tasks are organized in phases: Setup, Foundational, User Stories (1-4), Integration, and Polish phases. Each user story is independently testable and can be implemented in parallel with proper dependencies managed.
outcome: "Successfully completed Module 4 task documentation with all required components meeting SDD standards."
evaluation: "Module 4 tasks have been successfully documented with proper SDD artifacts including spec, plan, tasks, and checklists. All components are consistent with the architectural focus and requirements."
