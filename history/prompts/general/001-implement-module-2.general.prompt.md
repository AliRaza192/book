# Prompt History Record: Implement Module 2 Remaining Implementations

## Original Prompt
```
now you can implement module 2 remaining implementations in book-frontend folder and also module 1 is already in it.
```

## Response Summary
Successfully completed all remaining implementation tasks for Module 2 - Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo & Unity) in the book-frontend folder. All outstanding tasks from the tasks.md file were completed including:

- Added navigation links between chapters in Module 2
- Enhanced cross-references to Module 1 and added preview of Module 3
- Reviewed and ensured terminology consistency across all Module 2 chapters
- Updated Docusaurus sidebar with complete Module 2 structure
- Created summary and next-steps content for Module 2 conclusion
- Conducted final review for RAG indexing suitability
- Validated integration with Docusaurus sidebar navigation

Fixed broken links that were preventing successful Docusaurus build and ensured all content is properly integrated into the documentation site. The module is now complete with proper navigation, cross-references, and consistent terminology.

## Outcome
Module 2 implementation is now complete and fully integrated into the documentation site with successful build validation.
