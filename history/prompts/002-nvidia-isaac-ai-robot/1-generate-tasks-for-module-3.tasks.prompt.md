# Prompt History Record

## Original Prompt

```
complete module 3 all tasks.
```

## Response Summary

Generated a comprehensive tasks.md file for Module 3 - The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) following the spec-driven development approach. The tasks were organized by user stories in priority order:

- Phase 1: Setup Tasks
- Phase 2: Foundational Tasks
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Learn NVIDIA Isaac Fundamentals (P1)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Master Photorealistic Simulation Concepts (P1)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Comprehend Accelerated Perception Pipelines (P2)
- Phase 6: User Story 4 - Understand Humanoid Navigation Systems (P2)
- Phase 7: Integration and Continuity Tasks
- Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper sequential numbering, parallelization markers ([P]), and user story labels ([US1], [US2], etc.) where appropriate. Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities were documented, along with an implementation strategy focusing on MVP delivery of Chapter 1.

## Follow-up Actions

- Tasks can now be executed by development team
- Each chapter can be developed independently after foundational setup
- Quality gates established for each phase
