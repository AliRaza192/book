## Dependencies

User stories can be developed mostly independently, but with the following dependencies:
- Foundational tasks (Phase 2) must complete before any user story phases
- Chapter 1 (US1) should be completed before other chapters for foundational knowledge
- Integration tasks (Phase 7) require all user stories to be completed

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

Several tasks can be executed in parallel:
- Template creation and setup tasks can run simultaneously (T001-T005)
- Each chapter can be developed by different authors after foundational setup
- Diagram creation can run in parallel with content writing
- Reviews can be conducted in parallel with content development

## Implementation Strategy

1. **MVP Scope**: Complete Chapter 1 (VLA Overview) as the minimum viable product
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Deliver each chapter as it completes rather than waiting for full module
3. **Quality Gates**: Each chapter undergoes review before moving to next phase
4. **Continuous Integration**: Regular updates to navigation and cross-references as chapters complete
