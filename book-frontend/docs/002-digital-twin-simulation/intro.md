# Introduction to Digital Twin Simulation

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module introduces digital twins for humanoid robots using physics simulation and virtual environments to safely test perception, interaction, and motion.

## Module Overview

This module covers:

1. **Digital Twins and Physics Simulation Fundamentals** - Understanding what digital twins are and why they are critical for robotics
2. **Simulating Physics in Gazebo** - How Gazebo simulates physical laws like gravity, collisions, and dynamics
3. **High-Fidelity Environments and Interaction in Unity** - Unity's role in visual realism and human-robot interaction
4. **Simulating Robotic Sensors** - How common robot sensors like LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs are simulated

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Explain what a digital twin is and why it is critical for robotics
- Describe how Gazebo simulates physical laws and its role in robotics development
- Understand Unity's role in visual realism and interaction for digital twins
- Conceptually understand how common robot sensors are simulated in digital environments

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have foundational ROS 2 knowledge as covered in [Module 1 – The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/ros2-course-module/intro). This includes understanding ROS 2 concepts, nodes, topics, services, and basic Python agents.

## Target Audience

This module is designed for students who have completed [Module 1](/docs/ros2-course-module/intro) and want to understand digital twin technology for humanoid robots, including physics simulation, environment modeling, and sensor simulation.

## Relationship to Other Modules

This module builds upon the ROS 2 foundations established in [Module 1](/docs/ros2-course-module/intro) and serves as a bridge to Module 3 which will cover advanced robotics applications and AI integration.

### Connection to Module 1
[Module 1 – The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/ros2-course-module/intro) provided you with the foundational knowledge of ROS 2 concepts, nodes, topics, services, and basic Python agents. The communication frameworks and robotic architectures you learned there will be essential as you implement digital twin systems that interact with real robots.

### Preview of Module 3
Module 3 – Advanced Robotics Applications (AI & Motion Control) (coming soon) will build upon both the ROS 2 foundations from Module 1 and the digital twin simulation concepts from this module. In Module 3, you will explore:
- AI-powered robotic decision making and path planning
- Advanced motion control algorithms for humanoid robots
- Integration of perception, planning, and control systems
- Real-world deployment strategies combining simulation and physical systems
- Machine learning applications in robotics

## Chapter Standards

Each chapter in this module follows these standards:

- Clear definitions and conceptual explanations
- Progressive complexity from fundamentals to advanced concepts
- Tool roles clearly distinguished (Gazebo vs Unity)
- Docusaurus-compatible structure suitable for the learning platform
- Terminology consistent with Modules 1 and 3

## Success Criteria

This module is designed to achieve the following success criteria:

- Clean integration into Docusaurus sidebar navigation
- Clear conceptual separation of simulation tools (Gazebo and Unity)
- Content suitable for deterministic RAG indexing for future AI applications
- Terminology consistent with other modules in the course
