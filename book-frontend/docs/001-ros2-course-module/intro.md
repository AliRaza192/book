# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This module introduces Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as the "nervous system" of humanoid robots, providing the communication infrastructure that enables AI agents to interact with physical systems.

## Overview

ROS 2 serves as the middleware that connects different components of a robotic system, allowing them to communicate and coordinate effectively. This module will cover the fundamental concepts that make ROS 2 essential for humanoid robotics:

- **Chapter 1**: Introduction to ROS 2 and Middleware for Robots - Understanding ROS 2 as the nervous system of robots
- **Chapter 2**: ROS 2 Core Concepts - Nodes, Topics, and Services - Exploring the building blocks of ROS 2 communication
- **Chapter 3**: Bridging Python AI Agents to Robots using rclpy - Connecting AI logic to robot systems
- **Chapter 4**: Understanding Humanoid Structure with URDF - Representing robot structure and kinematics

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
1. Explain the role of ROS 2 as middleware in humanoid robotics
2. Describe how nodes communicate using topics and services
3. Understand how Python-based AI logic interfaces with ROS controllers
4. Conceptually understand humanoid URDF files

## Prerequisites

This module assumes you have basic knowledge of AI and Python programming. We'll focus on conceptual understanding rather than implementation details, providing you with the foundation needed for advanced robotics applications.

## Target Audience

This content is designed for students and professionals looking to understand how AI systems connect to physical robots through ROS 2, with a particular focus on humanoid robotics applications.
